- Class hierarchy shows full arrows for extends and dashed arrows for implements. These arrows have a big arrowhead. Also shows <<abstract>> or <<interface>> above a class.
- Associations shows the fields of a class. These arrows have a tiny arrowhead. A number at the arrowhead means it has that many. A * means a list of arbitrary size. A diamond at the base of the arrow indicates that the object is part of another object. When it is a bidirectional relation we remove the arrowhead for just a diamond with a straight line attached. T
